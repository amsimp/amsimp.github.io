      <description>Overview The main aim of AMSIMP is to develop an open-source solution that leverages machine learning to improve numerical weather prediction. Currently, as far as we are aware, there are no machine learning models in use for numerical weather prediction. Weâ€™re applying machine learning to weather prediction and making it available for everyone: citizens in particular. The goal of this page is to highlight the short and long term aims and goals of AMSIMP.</description>

      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t have Python yet and want the simplest way to get started, we recommend you use the Anaconda Distribution - it includes Python, NumPy, and some of the other necessary packages to successfully install and run the software.
AMSIMP can be installed with conda, or with pip. For more detailed instructions, consult our Python and AMSIMP installation guide below.
conda Before installation via this particular method, TensorFlow needs to be installed through the Python Package Index (PyPI) using the following command:</description>

      <description>AMSIMP 0.6.0 Release 2 Jan, 2021 &amp;ndash; AMSIMP 0.6.0 is now available. This is a major overhaul with the vast majority of the functionality available in previous versions of the software has now become deprecated. Evidently, the software is still in an alpha stage of release, however in the future, the software should not exhibit such feature breaking releases. The current model architecture is based on the ConvLSTM layer, and has a spatial resolution of approximately 100 kilometres.</description>
