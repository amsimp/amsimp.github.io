Please read the [AMSIMP Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) for guidance on how to interact with others in a way that makes the community thrive.

We offer several communication channels to learn, share your knowledge and connect with others within the AMSIMP community.


## Participate online

The following are ways to engage directly with the AMSIMP project and community.
_Please note that we encourage users and community members to support each other
for usage questions - see [Get Help](/gethelp)._


### AMSIMP mailing list

This list is the main forum for longer-form discussions, like adding new features to AMSIMP, making changes to the AMSIMP Roadmap, and all kinds of project-wide decision making.

### [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/amsimp/amsimp/issues)

- For bug reports (e.g. "`amsimp.Dynamics().simulate()` returns an outrageous temperature value, such as 42 K or 400 K in the case of Earth.");
- documentation issues (e.g. "I found this section unclear");
- and feature requests (e.g. "I would like to have the RRTM implemented directly into the software.").

### [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/amsimpworkspace/shared_invite/zt-fz2zx9na-g0JmP9BMtPOqBy7gWN0HLg)

A real-time chat room to ask questions about _contributing_ to AMSIMP.
This is a private space, specifically meant for people who are hesitant to
bring up their questions or ideas on a large public mailing list or GitHub.
